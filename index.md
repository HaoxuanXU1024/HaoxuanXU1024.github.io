# About Me

<img src="https://HaoxuanXU1024.github.io/haoxuan.jpg" class="floatpic" style="width: 150px; height: auto;">

Here is **Haoxuan Xu (Harrison, 徐浩轩)**.<br>

I am an MPhil student in System Hub/ROAS Trust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), advised by [Prof. Haoang Li](https://sites.google.com/view/haoangli/homepage). Previously, I earned my undergraduate degree from the School of Information Science and Engineering at Shandong University ([Chongxin College](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)) where I was supervised by [Prof. Yang Yang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/yangyang/zh_CN/index.htm).

## Research Interests

- Vision and Language Navigation
- Computer Vision

My research interests lie in ​Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN)​ and ​computer vision, with a focus on ​embodied AI for service robotics. ​Currently, I work on bridging advanced machine learning techniques with real-world applications, particularly in developing ​adaptive navigation systems​ that interpret natural language instructions and dynamic environments.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - hxu095 [at] connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn

### Abstract
We propose a Cross-Domain Car Detection model with integrated Convolutional Block Attention mechanism (CDCMA), featuring:
1. Complete cross-domain detection framework
2. Unpaired target domain image generation with car light emphasis
3. GIOU loss optimization
4. Dual-head CBAM architecture
